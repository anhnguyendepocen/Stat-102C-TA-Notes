This repository contains files for my Stat 102C sections.

Many of our discussion sections will involve me going over R code that’s relevant to what you’ve been learning that week. I’ll (hopefully) be uploading the code here by Tuesday night before our section.

**1st Week**

PI simulation.R: This is part of an assignment we had for Stat 202A, the grad-level intro R class. Along with reviewing key R concepts, this should demonstrate how (and why) we vectorize our code.

ReservoirSampling.R: this is an interesting problem (that is not directly applicable to this course, but is good to practice you R skills): how do we sample from a vector of unknown length? The R code is pretty basic, but if you can understand what the code does you will be ready for this course.

**2nd Week**

Rejection Sampling & Inverse CDF Sampling, yay!. These are both ways to use random samples from a very simple distribution (like uniform) to get samples from more complex (but usually univariate) distributions. 

Sampling from complex multivariate distributions is what MCMC algorithms are for - so hold your horses.
