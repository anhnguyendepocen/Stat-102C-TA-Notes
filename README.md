This repository contains files for my Stat 102C sections.

Many of our discussion sections will involve me going over R code that’s relevant to what you’ve been learning that week. I’ll (hopefully) be uploading the code here by Tuesday night before our section.

Note on the .Rnw files: if you're going to compile them into PDF's yourself, check your Rstudio preferences to see if it's going to use Sweave or Knitr. Make sure you're using the right one.

**1st Week**

PI simulation.R: This is part of an assignment we had for Stat 202A, the grad-level intro R class. Along with reviewing key R concepts, this should demonstrate how (and why) we vectorize our code.

ReservoirSampling.R: this is an interesting problem (that is not directly applicable to this course, but is good to practice you R skills): how do we sample from a vector of unknown length? The R code is pretty basic, but if you can understand what the code does you will be ready for this course.

**2nd Week**

Rejection Sampling & Inverse CDF Sampling, yay!. These are both ways to use random samples from a very simple distribution (like uniform) to get samples from more complex (but usually univariate) distributions. 

Sampling from complex multivariate distributions is what MCMC algorithms are for - so hold your horses.

**3rd Week**

Homework #1 hints. The solution will be posted once Prof. Wu is sure that nobody else will be turning it in.

**4th Week**

Monte Carlo integration, get psyched! A bit of classic MC integration & importance sampling.

Prof. Wu is letting you all re-do parts of HW1 for credit. So we'll give you even more hints.

**5th Week**

Went over HW2. Check the repository for Pseudo-code for Prob 3.2

**8th Week**

Week 8 already? HW3 solutions will be uploaded, and we're moving from MC into MCMC. Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings will be introduced. I highly recommend watching [this youtube video to understand MH samplers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1NOS_wxgGg).
