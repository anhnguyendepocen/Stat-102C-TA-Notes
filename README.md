This repository contains files relevant to my Stat 102C section.

Many of our discussion sections will involve me going over R code that’s relevant to what you’ve been learning that week. I’ll (hopefully) be uploading the code here by Tuesday night before our section.

**1st Week**

RejectionSampling.R: ...

ReservoirSampling.R: this is an interesting problem (that is not directly applicable to this course, but is good to practice you R skills): how do we sample from a vector of unknown length? The R code is pretty basic, but if you can understand what the code does you will be MORE than ready for this course.
